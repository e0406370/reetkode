  LCE 1859. Sorting the Sentence

  A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
  Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

  A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.
  - For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
  
  Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.

  Constraints:
  - 2 <= s.length <= 200
  - s consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, spaces, and digits from 1 to 9.
  - The number of words in s is between 1 and 9.
  - The words in s are separated by a single space.
  - s contains no leading or trailing spaces.
