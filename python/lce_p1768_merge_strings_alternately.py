LCE 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings word1 and word2.

Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1.
If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Constraints:
- 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
- word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

Topics:
- Two Pointers
- String
