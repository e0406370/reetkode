LCE 1165. Single-Row Keyboard (Premium)

There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.
Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25).

Initially, your finger is at index 0.
To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character.
The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.

You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.

Constraints:
- keyboard.length == 26
- keyboard contains each English lowercase letter exactly once in some order.
- 1 <= word.length <= 104
- word[i] is an English lowercase letter.

Topics:
- Hash Table
- String
