  LCE 507. Perfect Number

  A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself.
  A divisor of an integer x is an integer that can divide x evenly.

  Given an integer n, return true if n is a perfect number, otherwise return false.

  Constraints:
  - 1 <= nums <= 10^8
