-- Method 1: using ORDER BY and LIMIT
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(order_number) DESC
LIMIT 1

-- Method 2: using nested subqueries
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_number
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
    SELECT MAX(count)
    FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
        FROM Orders
        GROUP BY customer_number
    )
)
