  - (product_id) is the unique key for this table.
  - Each row in the table represents a product with its unique ID, name, and description.
  
  Write a solution to find all products whose description contains a valid serial number pattern. A valid serial number follows these rules:

  - It starts with the letters SN (case-sensitive).
  - Followed by exactly 4 digits.
  - It must have a hyphen (-) followed by exactly 4 digits.
  - The serial number must be within the description (it may not necessarily start at the beginning).
  
  Return the result table ordered by product_id in ascending order.

SELECT product_id, product_name, description
FROM products
WHERE description RLIKE '\\bSN[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}\\b'
ORDER BY 1
