  Table: Person

  +-------------+---------+
  | Column Name | Type    |
  +-------------+---------+
  | personId    | int     |
  | lastName    | varchar |
  | firstName   | varchar |
  +-------------+---------+
  - personId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
  - This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.
  

  Table: Address

  +-------------+---------+
  | Column Name | Type    |
  +-------------+---------+
  | addressId   | int     |
  | personId    | int     |
  | city        | varchar |
  | state       | varchar |
  +-------------+---------+
  - addressId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
  - Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.

  Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table.
  If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.
  
  Return the result table in any order.

-- Method 1: ON clause -> displays both columns
SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName, A.city, A.state
FROM Person P LEFT JOIN Address A 
ON P.personId = A.personId

-- Method 2: USING clause -> suppresses redundant columns
SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName, A.city, A.state
FROM Person P LEFT JOIN Address A 
USING(personId)
